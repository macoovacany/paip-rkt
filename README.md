This is a series of ports of the code from Peter Norvig's "Paradigms of 
Artificial Intelligence Programming: Case Studies in Common Lisp". The code, as indicated by the title, is provided in Common Lisp. 

The ports are going to be to Racket. Promesante has already started a similar project [paip-racket](https://github.com/promesante/paip-racket), where the code is direclt translated. The code within this project can not be promised to be translated directly.
